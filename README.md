***Soft Skills***
Today, Trainer has evaluated a mail written by one of my batchmates.
My learnings from his suggestions are
- Subject line really plays a crucial role from the receivers perspective.
- The intimation about attachemnts is a must.
- The name of the attachements can be descriptive so that the receiver can understand easily about it even without need for oepning it.
- To whom are we wrting the mail and what kind of salutation are we doing matters the most
  Ex - We can write a mail to a person and cannot say hello team and vice versa
- The content of the mail body should be consise
- While writing the body organisation, writing style and formality are some key aspects to look after
- Sentence formation and vocabulary selection for a particular mail is important
 
I have asked the trainer a question
- What is the decent size of a subject line?
  Ans - As long as it is in a line(as the name suggests) it is good. Basically 5-6 lines will be good enough as long as it is conveying the message.

Attempted email assessment and completed 3 out of 5 mails in the assessment.
